# Lorenz

Lorenz is a 3D application using OpenGL made during my preparatory class for a math project.

The subject was the application of the Runge-Kutta 4th order method to solve Lorenz's differential equations. This tool
allows you to navigate in the so-called Lorenz attractor which is a classic example of the chaos theory. You can create
multiple curves with different options and colors to illustrate the chaotic behavior.
